You are given the time series dataset describing the evolution of the number of Covid-19 infection cases 
in the period between January 11 and July 17, 2020. Your goal is to compare the disease development in 
two countries of your choice and make observations/conclusions about the character of this evolution 
(either in the commentaries to your python script or the separate text file). 
Choose the two countries and post your choices in the commentaries to this thread. 
You can pick only those countries that have not been picked by others. 
The following are mandatory components in your python script:

1. Import and clean the time series
2. Calculate measures of central tendency and spread of the two time-series. Write the results into an xlsx-file
3. Calculate frequencies of your time-series.
4. Choose the best number of bins for your time-series and show their histograms in the same plot.
5. Customize your histogram showing the legend, axis labels, specifying colors, etc.
6. Choose the best window size to calculate the moving averages of the time-series and plot these averages together with the time series.
7. Calculate and plot volatility of the time-series
8. Write the average and volatility time series to the .csv file
9. Make a regression analysis to determine if the two given time-series are linearly correlated
10. The code must contain at least one data type created by you
